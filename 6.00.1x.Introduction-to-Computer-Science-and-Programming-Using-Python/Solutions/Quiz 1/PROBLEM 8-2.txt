PROBLEM 8-2  (5 points possible)
Assuming you have corrected the implementation of the fixedPoint function, we can use it to compute other useful things such as square roots. In particular, the square root of a number, a, is the fixed point of the function f(x)=12(a/x+x).

The next two questions define two different implementations of this idea. Each has one incorrect line of code. The first is below:

def sqrt(a):
    def tryit(x):
        return 0.5 * (a/x + x)
    return fixedPoint(tryit(a), 0.0001)
This code has a bug in it. You can fix this by correcting exactly one line of the definition. Please do so in the box below.
